# UNOPS.Passenger
This is a upgraded version from the one in google doc.
The structure is still the same. No model class has been changed.
The mistake has been correct.
The first is the typo when creating the seat. Instead of Seat E it was typed to type C.
Making one row has 2 C seats.
The second is the crew time where the calulation is changed to fit with the requirment...
